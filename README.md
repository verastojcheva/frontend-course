# Project – Responsive Multi-Page Website

**Live site:** https://verastojcheva.github.io/frontend-course/ ← click to open

This is my **Frontend course project** (separate from the tutorial).  
It’s a small, responsive multi-page website built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS**.

---

## How to Run

- **Online (recommended):** Use the live URL above — no setup needed.
- **Locally in VS Code:**
  1. Install the **Live Server** extension.
  2. Open `project/index.html`.
  3. Click **Go Live** (bottom-right in the status bar).  
     Your browser will open the site locally.

> Note: All file paths are relative (e.g., `./css/styles.css`, `./about.html`) so it runs identically online and via Live Server.
