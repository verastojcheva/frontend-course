# Frontend-course
This repository contains my work for the **Software Development Skills: Frontend** course.

- `coursework/landing-site/` – a responsive landing page I built by following a video tutorial.
- `project/` – my separate course project (different from the tutorial; see course rules).
- `learning-diary.md` – dated reflections of what I did and learned.

## What I built (coursework)

**Stack:** HTML, CSS (variables, Grid & Flexbox), a little JavaScript.

**Key features**
- Semantic HTML structure (header, sections, footer)
- Navigation with a pure-CSS/JS mobile menu
- Buttons & small utility classes
- Card layout with **CSS Grid**
- FAQ “accordion” (using `<details>` or minimal JS)
- Responsive styles with media queries
- Deployed with GitHub Pages
