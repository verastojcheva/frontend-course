LEARNING DIARY

20.9.2025

Today I started the Software Development Skills: Frontend course by setting up my development environment. I already had VS Code installed on my Mac, so I focused on version control tools.

I confirmed that Git was already installed by checking the version in the terminal, and then decided to use GitHub Desktop to manage my repositories since Iâ€™m still learning Git commands. I created a public GitHub repository named frontend-course and connected it to my local computer using GitHub Desktop.

After that, I opened the repository in VS Code and added the main folder structure for the course: coursework, project, and a learning-diary.md file where I will continue writing my reflections. I also committed and pushed these changes to GitHub successfully.

This was my first step in preparing the tools for the course. I now understand the basics of how version control works with commits and pushes, and I feel more confident about using GitHub to track my progress. Next, I will start exploring the tutorial exercises and continue updating my learning diary along the way.
